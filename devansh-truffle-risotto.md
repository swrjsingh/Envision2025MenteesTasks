## Description
Truffle Risotto is a luxurious and creamy Italian dish that highlights the rich, earthy aroma of truffles. Originating from Northern Italy, this dish is perfect for special occasions or when you want to indulge in a decadent meal.

## Ingredients
- 1 1/2 cups Arborio rice
- 4 cups chicken or vegetable broth, warmed
- 1/2 cup dry white wine
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 small shallot, finely chopped
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 tablespoon truffle oil
- Fresh black truffle, shaved (optional, for garnish)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

## Instructions
1. In a large pan, melt 1 tablespoon of butter over medium heat and sauté the shallot until translucent.
2. Add the Arborio rice and toast it for about 2 minutes, stirring continuously.
3. Pour in the white wine and allow it to absorb completely while stirring.
4. Gradually add the warm broth, one ladle at a time, stirring constantly. Wait until the liquid is absorbed before adding more broth.
5. Continue this process until the rice is creamy and cooked al dente (about 18-20 minutes).
6. Stir in the remaining butter, Parmesan cheese, and truffle oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
7. Serve immediately, garnished with shaved black truffle if available.

## Tips
- Stir continuously while cooking to achieve a creamy texture.
- Use high-quality truffle oil for the best flavor.
- Warm the broth before adding it to the risotto to ensure even cooking.

## Variations
- Add sautéed mushrooms for extra depth of flavor.
- Substitute the white wine with champagne for an even more elegant touch.
- Use Pecorino Romano cheese instead of Parmesan for a slightly sharper taste.
