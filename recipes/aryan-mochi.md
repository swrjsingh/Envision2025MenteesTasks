**Created by:** Aryan Palimkar  

## Description  
Takoyaki is a popular Japanese street food originating from Osaka. These delicious octopus-filled balls are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, often topped with takoyaki sauce, mayonnaise, bonito flakes, and seaweed.  

## Ingredients  
- 1 cup all-purpose flour  
- 1 tsp baking powder  
- 1 egg  
- 1 cup dashi stock (or water)  
- 100g cooked octopus, diced  
- 2 tbsp green onions, chopped  
- 1 tbsp pickled ginger, chopped  
- Takoyaki sauce (to taste)  
- Mayonnaise (to taste)  
- Bonito flakes (optional)  
- Seaweed powder (optional)  

## Instructions  
1. In a bowl, mix flour, baking powder, egg, and dashi stock until smooth.  
2. Preheat a takoyaki pan and lightly oil the molds.  
3. Pour the batter into the molds until nearly full.  
4. Add a piece of octopus, green onions, and pickled ginger into each mold.  
5. Cook for 1-2 minutes, then use a skewer to rotate the takoyaki balls until golden brown on all sides.  
6. Once cooked, transfer to a plate and drizzle with takoyaki sauce and mayonnaise.  
7. Sprinkle with bonito flakes and seaweed powder before serving.  

## Tips  
- Make sure the pan is hot enough before pouring the batter to get a crispy exterior.  
- Rotate the takoyaki frequently for an even round shape.  

## Variations  
- Substitute octopus with shrimp or cheese for a different flavor.  
- Add kimchi or spicy sauce for a fusion twist.
