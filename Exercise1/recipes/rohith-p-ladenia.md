### Created by: [Rohith P]

## Description
Ladenia is a traditional Greek flatbread from the island of Kimolos. It’s often described as Greece’s version of pizza but without cheese

## Ingredients
- [2 cups] [Flour]
- [0.5 cup] [Olive oil]
- [0.5 cup] [Water]


## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 200°C (400°F).
2. In a bowl, mix flour, olive oil, and water until a dough forms.
3. Roll out the dough on a baking sheet and bake for 20–25 minutes until golden.


## Tips
For the best Ladenia, use high-quality extra virgin olive oil

## Variations
A tasty variation of Ladenia is to add crumbled feta cheese on top before baking. This gives it a creamy, salty contrast to the sweet tomatoes and onions while keeping it simple and authentic.
